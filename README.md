This class can command supported DSLR cameras to capture photos or video,
configure file download and change camera settings such as ISO, exposure,
focus, aperture(fnumber), flash, white balance, compression, etc.

Setup:

1.Install and run digiCamControl, BETA v2.0.69 or greater, from:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/digicamcontrol/files/latest/download
  (digiCamControl is a multi purpose, free, open source, Windows only
  application that can control a host of supported cameras)

2.Connect one or more camera by USB or WiFi to the PC and ensure
  digiCamControl detects the camera(s). 
  (This class communicates with camera(s) via digiCamControl, using the
  inbuilt HTTP Webserver, when enabled, or CMD Utility.) 

3.To enable Webserver go to File>Settings>Webserver (RESTART REQUIRED).
  (Webserver is MUCH faster and allows camera(s) to be controlled from
  other networked computers running MatLab, even LINUX - not tested!)

4.Read the help and try an example. For digiCamControl documentation,
  forums or to make a donation visit http://digiCamControl.com
